## Abstract
[Zeus IoT](https://www.zmops.com/) is a **distributed IoT collection, analysis, and storage platform**,It is the world's first IoT open source platform based on zabbix secondary development, all this relies on a group of engineers with rich experience in zabbix development.It is hoped that through the community‚Äôs open source ecology, continuous improvement and continuous updates will make some contributions to the development of the Internet of Things industry.

The following screenshots give a close insight into Zeus IoT.

## Features
<details>
  <summary><b>üèÜBased on <i>zabbix</i> secondary development</b></summary>
  Based on the powerful <a href="http://www.zabbix.com">Zabbix</a> for interface secondary development, with industrial-grade stability and powerful performance.
</details>
<details>
  <summary><b>ü•áBased on <i>Apache Camel</i> as the pre-routing rule</b></summary>
  Very powerful rule-based routing engine, supports 300+ module access, including IoT protocols, born for low code; one line of code can start the protocol service interface.
</details>
<details>
  <summary><b>ü•âUse <i>TDEngine</i> for time series data storage by default</b></summary>
  <a href="https://www.taosdata.com/">TDEngine</a> is an ultra-high performance distributed database designed and optimized for time series data.
</details>
<details>
  <summary><b>‚öîÔ∏èIoT Server is developed with a <i>modular architecture</i></b></summary>
  IoT Server adopts the <a href="https://github.com/apache/skywalking">Skywalking</a> modular architecture design, which can dynamically configure and enable modules, which is very easy to expand; at the same time, combined with the multi-point collection of Zabbix Proxy, a modular cluster can be implemented well.
</details>
<details>
  <summary><b>üèπNatural distributed collection architecture</b></summary>
  Thanks to Zabbix's excellent architecture design, it has natural distributed collection capabilities, can be well horizontally expanded, and has the ability to cross-region and cross-network collection
